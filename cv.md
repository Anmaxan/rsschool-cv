## Briefly about me:
During my university study I came to idea, that Mechanical Engineering I study currently is not the only sphere I want to grow at, so I chose IT, specifically Front-end Development, as the second (and more interesting for me) one. So now I spend a big part of my time off-university for learning Front-end Development, which will offer me many possibilites in near future.


## Skills:
* HTML5, CSS3
* JavaScript basics
* Git, GitHub basics
* VS Code


## Code example:
```
function findOutlier(integers){
 let odds = [];
 let evens = [];
  
  for (let i= 0; i < integers.length; i++){
       if ((integers[i] % 2) == 0) {
            evens.push(integers[i]);
        } else {
            odds.push(integers[i]);
        }
  }
   if (odds.length > evens.length){
     return evens[0];
   } else{
     return odds[0]
   }
    
}
```
